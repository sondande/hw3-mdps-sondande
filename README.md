HW3: Robotic Wildfire Suppression (Markov Decision Processes)

1. 𝛾 appears to be positively correlated with the average utility earned by the agent. When we started with a 𝛾 of 0.1, we had a negative utility(-8.2). As we increased 𝛾, it became positive at 0.5 and then continued to increase to 0.9. This trend implies that larger gamma values when creating policy leads to more utility in a simulation. Practically, this shows that...

A paragraph discussing how 𝛾 impacted the average utility earned by the agent – do you see any trends? What do you think these trends imply, and why did they occur?
2. A couple paragraphs documenting how you designed and implemented the MDP in your program? What design options did you consider, and how did you decide on this implementation?
3. A short paragraph describing your experience during the assignment (what did you enjoy, what was difficult, etc.)
4. Probably about 20 Hours.
5. We have affirmed to the Honor Code on this Assignment.
